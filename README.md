### Hi there 👋
My name is Deepak, and I run <a href="https://consolelogs.in" target="_blank">Console Logs</a> and <a href="https://circuitparts.in" target="_blank">Circuit Parts</a>. I studied electrical engineering in college, and after seeing the excitement in the software industry, I was hooked. I wanted to work with software and write code. I started my career working for a company as an Embedded Software Engineer writing firmware for 32-bit microcontrollers and microprocessors, and then after few years I moved on to writing code to build web apps that solve real problems in the hardware community. During the same time I've also started to build Console Logs - A marketplace to sell digital creations and get paid.

In short I've coding for over 7 years now. First few years I wrote low level firmware using C and from the last 4 years I've been working on building web apps using Next.js and Ruby on Rails.

## Projects

### Console Logs

## Note on my Contributions Graph
Just a heads up, my GitHub profile might not reflect my full coding history. I've used different accounts in the past, and occasionally even had to reset things by deleting the .git directory.  Rest assured, there's more to my coding journey than this graph shows!
